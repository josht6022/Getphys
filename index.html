						<h2>Physics Resources</h2>
						<p> This website is dedicated to pooling all the online resources for studying physics.<br />
						Most of the videos and links are geared towards first year physics students. <br />

						In addition, I have added an entire section of physics related videos that truly are mind blowing. <br /> 

						I hope that beyond learning how to solve problems, these videos will inspire you as well.</p>

                <p>Sometimes learning physics for the first time can leave you in the stars...literally. There's a necessity to redefine terms you've heard all you life, like momentum or power. These words mean something very different to physicist. However, with the right tools, physics is within anyone's reach. To be clear, this website is showing you only a small fraction of those tools. The other tools come with a great amount of energy devoted to understanding the material. </p>
